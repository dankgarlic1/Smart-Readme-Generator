## 🚧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter the following error:

```
file:///C:/Users/Dell/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/smart-readme-generator/node_modules/openai/index.mjs:30
throw new Errors.OpenAIError("The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is missing or empty; either provide it, or instantiate the OpenAI client with an apiKey option, like new OpenAI({ apiKey: 'My API Key' }).");
^
OpenAIError: The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is missing or empty; either provide it, or instantiate the OpenAI client with an apiKey option, like new OpenAI({ apiKey: 'My API Key' }).
at new OpenAI (file:///C:/Users/Dell/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/smart-readme-generator/node_modules/openai/index.mjs:30:19)
at file:///C:/Users/Dell/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/smart-readme-generator/index.js:15:16
at ModuleJob.run (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:194:25)
```

**Solution/Approach:**

1. **If you have a `.env` file at the root of your project directory** (e.g., `a/v/myproject/.env` or `.env.local`), ensure that it contains your OpenAI API key. Run the command `smart-readme-generator` from the root directory of your project.

2. **If your project has a different structure with subdirectories (e.g., `frontend` or `backend`) and no `.env` file at the root**:
   - Place the `.env` file containing your API key in one of the subdirectories.
   - Use `cd` to change to that directory and run the `smart-readme-generator` command from there.

### Diagram

Here’s a simple diagram to illustrate the structure:

```
myproject/
│
├── .env (contains API key) or
│
├── frontend/
│   └── .env (contains API key) or
│
├── backend/
│   └── .env (contains API key)
│
└── smart-readme-generator (run command from here or subdirectory)
```
